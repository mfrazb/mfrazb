### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on TBC, a food co-op grocery ordering and member management app. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning domain-driven design and how to translate business requirements into code. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Hear Changes, an open source tool I'm developing for affordable housing professionals and community advocates to track rezoning hearings in neighborhoods.
