### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on TBC, a food co-op grocery ordering and member management app. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and how to work with Docker, AWS, and the CI/CD pipeline. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
- ðŸ¤” I'd love your thoughts on how to enhance TBC's front end and any npm packages that could accelerate TBC's development.
